Did you know you can personalize your Meshtastic devices with emojis, making them stand out in a unique and fun way! By default, the `Short Name` for your device is auto-generated using the last four characters of its MAC address. However, you can customize this `Short Name` to make it truly yours. Even better, using **emojis** adds a visually distinctive touch, making it easier to identify your node at a glance!

## How It Works 🛠️

Your Meshtastic device’s `Short Name` is limited to **4 bytes**. Many emojis are a great fit because they use only 1–4 bytes; however, some—such as certain flags or more intricate emojis—exceed the 4-byte limit and won’t work.

Thankfully, most Meshtastic client apps include validation to ensure you don’t accidentally use an emoji that exceeds the 4-byte limit. However, not all clients enforce this restriction directly. Regardless, the protocol enforces a strict 5-byte limit (1 byte for overhead, leaving 4 bytes for the emoji itself). If you attempt to set a larger emoji, either the client app or the firmware will prevent it from being saved.

To customize the `Short Name`, refer to the [User Config documentation](/docs/configuration/radio/user/#user-config-client-availability) for instructions on where to make the change for your preferred client.

Once you’ve saved the changes, your device will appear with your custom emoji `Short Name` in the client applications.

## Why Use Emojis as Your Short Name? ✨

Customizing your `Short Name` with emojis isn’t just a quirky feature—it’s a creative way to express the purpose or personality of your device. For instance:

- If your node’s Long Name is **“Crichton’s Car”**, you could set the `Short Name` to 🚗.
- Deploying a node near your campsite? 🏕️ would be perfect.
- Setting up a device for a hiking trip? Try 🥾 or 🌲.

This adds both customization and a unique identity, making it easier for others to recognize your device in the network. For example, each emoji can convey the purpose or personality of the node, adding a touch of creativity to your setup.

## Get Creative! 🎨

The possibilities are endless. You can pick emojis based on:

- **Location**: A 🌊 for coastal areas, 🏜️ for deserts, or 🏔️ for mountain regions.
- **Purpose**: 📡 for a relay node, 🏠 for a home base station, or 🛶 for boating adventures.
- **Personality**: 😎 for a cool vibe, 💡 for an innovative setup, or 🧙‍♂️ for something magical.

The nodes list becomes much more visually engaging and easier to navigate when each node is represented by a unique emoji. It’s a fun and functional way to distinguish between devices at a glance.
